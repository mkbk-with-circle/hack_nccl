Holistic Trace Analysis
=======================
Holistic Trace Analysis (HTA) is an open source performance analysis and
visualization Python library for PyTorch users. HTA takes as input `Kineto
traces <https://github.com/pytorch/kineto>`_ collected by the `PyTorch Profiler
<https://pytorch.org/blog/introducing-pytorch-profiler-the-new-and-improved-performance-tool/>`_
and up-levels the performance information contained in the traces.

ML researchers and systems engineers often struggle to computationally scale up
their models because they are not aware of the performance bottlenecks in their
workloads. The resources requested for a job (e.g. GPUs, memory) are often
misaligned with the resources actually required due to lack of visibility
“under the hood”.

The goal of HTA is to help engineers and researchers achieve the best
performance from the hardware stack. For this to happen it is imperative to
understand the resource utilization and bottlenecks for distributed training
and inference workloads.

Features in Holistic Trace Analysis
***********************************

To aid in performance debugging HTA provides the following features

#. `Temporal Breakdown <source/features/temporal_breakdown.html>`_: Breakdown of GPU time in
   terms of time spent in computation, communication, memory events, and idle
   time on a single node and across all ranks.

#. `Idle Time Breakdown <source/features/idle_time_breakdown.html>`_: Breakdown of GPU idle
   time into waiting for the host, waiting for another kernel or attributed to
   an unknown cause.

#. `Kernel Breakdown <source/features/kernel_breakdown.html>`_: Find
   kernels with the longest duration on each rank.

#. `Kernel Duration Distribution <source/features/kernel_breakdown.html#kernel-duration-distribution>`_: Distribution of average time
   taken by longest kernels across different ranks.

#. `Communication Computation Overlap <source/features/comm_comp_overlap.html>`_: Calculate the
   percentage of time when communication overlaps computation.

#. `CUDA Kernel Launch Statistics <source/features/cuda_kernel_launch_stats.html>`_: Distributions
   of GPU kernels with very small duration, large duration, and excessive
   launch time.

#. `Augmented Counters (Memory copy bandwidth, Queue length) <source/features/augmented_counters.html>`_:
   Augmented trace files which provide insights into memory copy bandwidth and
   number of outstanding operations on each CUDA stream.

#. `Frequent CUDA Kernel Patterns <source/features/frequent_cuda_kernels.html>`_: Find the CUDA
   kernels most frequently launched by any given PyTorch or user defined
   operator.

#. `Trace Diff <source/features/trace_diff.html>`_: A trace comparison tool to identify and
   visualize the differences between traces.

#. `CUPTI Counter Analysis <source/features/cupti_counter_analysis.html>`_: An
   experimental API to interpret GPU performance counters. It attributes
   performance measurements from kernels to PyTorch operators, and can help
   with kernel optimization and roofline analysis.

#. `Lightweight Critical Path Analysis <source/features/lightweight_critical_path_analysis.html>`_: An
   experimental API to compute the critical path in the trace. Critical path
   can help one undertand if an application is CPU bound, GPU compute bound or
   communication bound. The path can be visualized on the original trace
   as well as manipulated as a directed acyclic graph object.
